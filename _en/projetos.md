## Research

### BioEduca: development of pedagogical materials and teaching-learning strategies for Biology

The growing complexity of socio-environmental challenges demands a critical and engaged scientific education, especially in high school, where students develop essential skills for understanding and acting on environmental changes. This project aims to develop innovative pedagogical materials and/or teaching-learning strategies that integrate scientific knowledge with teacher training. The intention is to enable a critical understanding of the interactions between biological and social systems, encouraging reasoned decision-making on contemporary environmental and technological issues.

- **Period:** 2025 - present.
- **Participants:** Milena Ramires - Coordinator / Mariana Clauzet / Matheus Marcos Rotundo/ Maira Begalli/ Amanda Aparecida Carminatto/ Ricardo Guimarães/ Felipe Schmidt Fonseca/ Maria Luiza de Lima Guedes/ Leticia Vieira Silva / Ian Costa.
- **Funding:** São Paulo Research Foundation.


### Ichthyofauna of EEJI: Subsidies for Integrated Management of the Mosaic Conservation Units

The Juréia Itatins Ecological Station (EEJI) is part of an area of extreme ecological and socio-environmental importance, which houses a significant portion of the Atlantic Forest with great biodiversity and endemism and is immersed in a Mosaic of Conservation Units (UCs) of the State of São Paulo. This project seeks to evaluate the structure of the EEJI's ichthyofauna community and estimate the population genomic structure of the fat snook _Centropomus parallelus_, one of the most important regional fishing and socioeconomic resources.

- **Period:** 2023 - present.
- **Participants:** Milena Ramires - Coordinator / Mariana Clauzet / Miguel Petrere Jr/ Matheus Marcos Rotundo / Amanda Aparecida Carminatto/ Claudio Oliveira/ Bruno Lopes da Silva Ferrette.
- **Funding:** São Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP.

## Extension

### Citizen science, Critical Appropriation of Technologies and Socio-environmental Actions in Coastal Populations

The proposal is linked to the ETNOPESCA project: Socio-environmental Actions in Vulnerable Coastal Communities, and aims to carry out open and citizen science actions, aimed at the critical appropriation of free and open information and communication technologies (ICTs), capable of democratizing access to and dissemination of research data. To this end, we will promote actions that can support the formulation of relevant socio-environmental policies for sustainable development, citizenship, social participation, and quality of life. The productions of this project are available at [maedagua.fonte.wiki](http://maedagua.fonte.wiki).

- **Period:** 2025 - present.
- **Participants:** Milena Ramires - Coordinator / Mariana Clauzet / Maira Begalli/ Ricardo Guimarães/ Felipe Schmidt Fonseca.
- **Funding:** Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES.


### ETNOPESCA: Socio-environmental Actions in Vulnerable Coastal Communities

The Project arose from the initiative of professors from the Postgraduate courses at Santa Cecília University (UNISANTA), for the development of research and socio-environmental actions aimed at the sustainability of fishing, through the involvement of fishing communities in the management and conservation of nature. The general objective of the proposal is to support extension actions aimed at socio-environmental issues in vulnerable and/or traditional communities in the Baixada Santista region (SP), aiming at the training of young people and adults for environmental conservation, sustainability, and income generation. With this, it is expected to expand the integration between the academic community and society through the exchange of knowledge, participation, and contact with the complex socio-environmental issues of the region.

- **Period:** 2024 - present
- **Participants:** Milena Ramires - Coordinator / Matheus Marcos Rotundo / Vinicius Roveri / Bruna Cabral Carneiro Batista - Member / Jorge Luis dos Santos - Member / Thiago Dal Negro / Cyro Purificação Neto/ Leticia Vieira Silva.
