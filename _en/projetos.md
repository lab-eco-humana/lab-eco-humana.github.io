The Juréia Itatins Ecological Station (EEJI) is part of an area of extreme ecological and socio-environmental importance, which houses a significant portion of the Atlantic Forest with great biodiversity and endemism and is immersed in a Mosaic of Conservation Units (CUs) of the State of São Paulo. Its diverse ichthyofauna establishes interactions with the bordering conservation units, with different protection categories. This project aims to evaluate the structure of the ichthyofauna community of the EEJI and to estimate the population genomic structure of the fat snook *Centropomus parallelus*, one of the most important regional fishing and socioeconomic resources. To this end, specimens of the ichthyofauna will be collected through experimental fishing with gillnets at eight points on the Una River in the four climatic seasons and two sampling campaigns on the Verde River and adjacent coastal zones. Meanwhile, for the evaluation of the population genomic structure of *C. parallelus*, collections will be carried out on the Verde River and in the adjacent coastal zone. At each sampling point, the physical-chemical factors will be characterized and, in the laboratory, the fish will be morphologically identified, measured, weighed, and a description of the macro gonadal maturation stages will be carried out. Analyses will be carried out considering the abundance by trophic guilds, diversity descriptors and energy increment indices. In the molecular analyses, the population genomic structure, evaluation of local adaptation, levels of genetic diversity and estimate of the effective population size will be estimated. With these results, it will be possible to assist in the integrated management of the CUs of the Juréia Itatins Mosaic, in line with the Aichi Targets and the Biodiversity convention and to integrate new results with those obtained in previous funding for research in the Juréia Itatins Mosaic area (FAPESP: 2019/19431-8), where it became clear that snooks, especially *C. parallelus*, represent an essential resource for the regional socio-economy, which makes it essential to know about their populations, understand their behavior and ecological functions in the different conservation units of the mosaic.
